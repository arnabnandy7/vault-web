# Frontend

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.11.

## Vault-Web specific configuration

### External links (navbar dropdown / mobile menu)

The external links are loaded at runtime from: `public/runtime-config.local.js` (gitignored)

Therefore edit `public/runtime-config.local.js` to add your own external links.

Links can opt in to forwarding the current Vault Web access token in the URL
fragment. The target service must explicitly support that handoff:

```js
{
  name: "Habits",
  url: "http://localhost:9001/vault-web-login",
  forwardVaultWebToken: true,
}
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
