# Vault Web

**Vault Web** is the core project of the **Vault Web ecosystem**.
It is a full-stack application combining a **Spring Boot backend**, an **Angular frontend**, and a **PostgreSQL** database.

Vault Web acts as a **central dashboard** for a modular, self-hosted home server ecosystem. It provides a single entry point where multiple services are integrated into one secure web interface.

---

## What Vault Web Provides

Vault Web is responsible for:

- 💬 **Internal chats and collaboration tools**
- 🧑‍💻 **User and session management**
- 🔐 **Central authentication (JWT-based)**
- 🧩 **Frontend integration of external services**

Additional services are **not implemented directly in this repository**, but are embedded into the Vault Web frontend.

For example, file storage and file management are provided by the **Cloud Page** service:
👉 https://github.com/Vault-Web/cloud-page

## Project Structure

- 📁 [**DIRECTORY.md**](https://github.com/Vault-Web/vault-web/blob/main/DIRECTORY.md) – generated project structure overview
- 📚 [**Javadoc**](https://vault-web.github.io/vault-web) – backend API documentation

---

## Local Development

For local development and contributions, it is recommended to fork the repository first.
Vault Web uses **Docker** for local development.

### Requirements

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Java 21+ (Java 24 supported)
- Node.js & npm

---

If you plan to contribute, clone your fork instead of the main repository.

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vault-Web/vault-web.git
cd vault-web
```

---

## 2. Environment Configuration (`.env`)

⚠️ **You do NOT need to create a `.env` file manually.**
A `.env` file already exists in the repository.

You may adjust the values if needed, but make sure that:

> **The database configuration in `.env` matches exactly with the backend `application.properties`.**

---

## 3. Start PostgreSQL and pgAdmin

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

- PostgreSQL: `localhost:<DB_PORT>`
- pgAdmin: [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)

---

## 4. Backend (Spring Boot)

The backend can run in **HTTP** or **HTTPS** mode:

### HTTP Mode (API testing only)

For backend and frontend development over plain HTTP on localhost.

```bash
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

- API: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- Swagger UI: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

### HTTPS Mode (full-stack development)

For development with the Angular frontend, as it requires HTTPS for secure cookies and JWT authentication.

**Start with HTTPS:**

```bash
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
```

- API: [https://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080)
- Swagger UI: [https://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](https://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

⚠️ **Browser Warning:** You will see a security warning about a self-signed certificate. This is normal for local development. Accept the warning to proceed.

> **Database Configuration:** Ensure the database values in `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties` match the `.env` file.

### Timezone configuration (important for some environments)

On some systems, the backend may fail to start because PostgreSQL rejects a deprecated JVM timezone identifier during startup.

If you encounter an error like:

```text
FATAL: invalid value for parameter "TimeZone"
```

see [common_problems.md](./common_problems.md) for platform-specific troubleshooting and startup guidance.

## 5. Frontend (Angular)

Frontend can run against HTTP backend (default) or HTTPS backend.

### Default local mode (HTTP)

The default `frontend/src/environments/environment.ts` uses:

- `useHttps = false`
- backend base URL `http://localhost:8080`

Run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start -- --ssl false
```

Open:
👉 [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

Note:

- In this project, `npm start` maps to `ng serve --ssl` (HTTPS).
- For HTTP, explicitly pass `--ssl false` (or run `npx ng serve --ssl false`).

### HTTPS dev mode (optional)

If you run backend with `-Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev` (HTTPS), set:

- `useHttps = true` in `frontend/src/environments/environment.ts`

Then run frontend with SSL:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

Open:
👉 [https://localhost:4200](https://localhost:4200)

### External links in navbar (runtime config)

The external links are loaded at runtime from: `frontend/public/runtime-config.local.js` (gitignored)

Therefore edit `public/runtime-config.local.js` to add your own external links.

An external service that explicitly supports Vault Web JWT handoff can opt in
with `forwardVaultWebToken: true`. Vault Web then appends the current access
token to that link's URL fragment instead of sending it to every external link.
